HR Analytics Dashboard: Employee Attrition Insights and Workforce Analysis

Project Detail
This project presents an interactive HR Analytics Dashboard designed to analyze employee attrition and key workforce metrics. The dashboard visualizes how factors such as years at the company, age, education, gender, salary, job role, and job satisfaction relate to employee turnover, enabling HR professionals and business leaders to make data-driven decisions for talent management and retention.
Short Description / Purpose
The HR Analytics Dashboard aims to provide a comprehensive overview of employee attrition patterns within an organization. By leveraging interactive visualizations and filters, stakeholders can identify trends, uncover drivers of attrition, and optimize HR strategies to improve employee retention and satisfaction.

Tech Stack
•	Frontend: Power BI (for dashboard creation and interactive visualizations)
•	Backend/Data Processing: Power Query (for data cleaning and transformation)
•	Data Storage: CSV or Excel files sourced from online repositories
•	Integration: Power BI slicers for dynamic filtering by Marital Status, Job Satisfaction, Job Role, and Gender

Data Source
The dataset used for this dashboard was sourced from a reputable online open data repository. It contains anonymized HR records, including fields such as employee ID, years at company, age, education, gender, salary, job role, job satisfaction, attrition status, and marital status. The data was cleaned and standardized using Power Query before integration into Power BI for analysis[1].
Features / Highlights
•	Attrition by Years at Company: Line chart showing the count of employees who left the company based on their tenure.
•	Attrition by Age: Line chart visualizing attrition counts across different age groups.
•	Attrition by Education & Gender: Donut charts displaying the proportion of attrition by education level and gender.
•	Attrition by Salary: Bar chart comparing total salary distribution between employees who stayed and those who left.
•	Job Role & Satisfaction Table: Interactive table listing job roles alongside job satisfaction scores.
•	Dynamic Filters: Slicers for Marital Status, Job Satisfaction, Job Role, and Gender to enable focused analysis.

Example
An HR manager uses the dashboard to filter for employees in the "Sales Executive" role with low job satisfaction. The visualizations reveal a spike in attrition among this group, prompting targeted interventions such as tailored engagement programs or compensation reviews.

Key Questions Addressed by the Dashboard
•	Which employee groups (by age, tenure, education, gender, or salary) are most at risk of attrition?
•	How does job satisfaction correlate with attrition across different job roles?
•	Are there specific job roles experiencing higher turnover rates?
•	What is the distribution of attrition by education level and gender?
•	How does salary impact employee retention?
•	Can filtering by marital status, job satisfaction, or job role uncover hidden attrition patterns?
